            I'm a software engineer based in Dhanbad, Jharkhand. I enjoy
            creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites,
            applications, or anything in between. I have been working for 3
            year, with a demonstrated history of working in the Computer
            Software industry. Skilled in Front-end Development. I have 3 years
            of experience in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, tailwind
            CSS, StyledComponent, React JS and Next JS. Hence, I have
            successfully completed several web projects from scratch. Yet, I
            learn continuously and never stop exploring new technologies. So, I
            have also gained knowledge of Node JS, Express JS, Mongo DB, Python,
            firebase and React Native with time.
